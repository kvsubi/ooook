# Setup

To init the project, `yarn install`

Create a `.env` file in the root dir with contents matching `example.env`

To run the website, `yarn dev`

Other commands can be found in `package.json`

# Developer Guidelines
Each change you commit should be committed to a different branch, not the **main** branch. Before committing make sure to run `yarn format` - That'll save you a lot of headaches later. Apart from that, there's not really much to add on. Enjoy!

# Pull Requests
Pull Requests should be viewed by another **developer** and then **SQUASHED AND MERGED** for organization. Without squashing and merging it makes the commit history look like  a bunch of shit for the main project, I don't want that.
